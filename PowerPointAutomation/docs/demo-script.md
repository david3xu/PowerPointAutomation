   ```

## Step 2: Build the Solution

1. Right-click on the solution in Solution Explorer and select "Restore NuGet Packages"
2. From the Build menu, select "Build Solution" (or press Ctrl+Shift+B)
3. Verify that the build completes successfully with no errors

## Step 3: Run the Application

1. Press F5 to start debugging (or Ctrl+F5 to run without debugging)
2. Observe the console output as the presentation is generated:
   ```

   Presentation successfully created at: C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\KnowledgeGraphPresentation.pptx
   Opening the presentation for review...
   Press any key to exit...
   ```
3. PowerPoint will automatically open to display the generated presentation

## Step 4: Examine the Generated Presentation

The generated presentation consists of 12 professionally formatted slides:

### Slide 1: Title Slide

- Thoughtful color-coding (advantages vs. challenges)

### Slide 11: Future Directions
- Outlines emerging trends in knowledge graph technology
- Hierarchical bullet points with clear organization
- Consistent animation pattern with previous slides
- Forward-looking content to conclude the main body

### Slide 12: Conclusion
- Summary of key points
- "Thank You" message with contact information
- Call to action
- Visual emphasis on key takeaways
- Speaker notes with final talking points

## Step 5: Review Animation and Transitions

1. Start the slideshow (F5 in PowerPoint)
2. Click through each slide to observe:
   - Consistent slide transitions
   - Professional bullet point animations
   - Diagram build animations
   - Emphasis effects on key elements
3. Note how animations enhance understanding by revealing information progressively

## Step 6: Examine Speaker Notes

1. In PowerPoint, view the presentation in Notes view (View → Notes Page)
2. Each slide contains detailed speaker notes that:
   - Provide context for the slide content
   - Offer talking points for presenters
   - Suggest emphasis areas
   - Include transition phrases between slides

## Customization Options

After reviewing the presentation, here are some ways you could customize it:

### Content Customization
```csharp
// In KnowledgeGraphData.cs, modify slide content:
slides.Add(2, new BulletSlideContent(
    "Your Custom Title",  // Change title
    new string[] {        // Modify bullet points
        "Your first custom point",
        "Your second custom point",
        "Your third custom point"
    },
    "Your custom speaker notes"  // Add your notes
));
```

### Visual Customization
```csharp
// In KnowledgeGraphPresentation.cs, update theme colors:
private readonly Color primaryColor = Color.FromArgb(0, 112, 192);    // Change to bright blue
private readonly Color secondaryColor = Color.FromArgb(0, 176, 80);   // Change to green
private readonly Color accentColor = Color.FromArgb(255, 102, 0);     // Change to bright orange
```

### Animation Customization
```csharp
// In DiagramSlide.cs, modify animation timing:
effect.Timing.Duration = 0.3f;  // Make animations faster (default: 0.5f)
```
